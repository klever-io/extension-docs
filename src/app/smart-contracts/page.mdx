# Klever Smart Contracts

The Klever Blockchain's virtual machine (VM) executes [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly). This means that it can execute smart contracts
written in _any programming language_ that can be compiled to WASM bytecode. **Though, we only provide support for Rust.**

Developers are encouraged to use Rust for their smart contracts, however. Klever provides a [Rust framework](https://github.com/klever-io/klever-vm-sdk-rs)
which allows for unusually clean and efficient code in smart contracts, a rarity in the blockchain field.
A declarative testing framework is bundled as well. For the best coding experience,
developers have the [Klever IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com) at their disposal.
