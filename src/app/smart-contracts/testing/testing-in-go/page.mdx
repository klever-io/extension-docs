# Testing In Go

In the past, we developed some testing solutions in Go, although they were not widely adopted. However, they are still worth mentioning.

Please note that this page is currently a stub. If there is interest in this type of testing, we are open to expanding it further.

## Embedding in Go

Scenario steps can be embedded in Go, allowing for more flexible behavior programming. It is even possible to save dynamically generated scenarios. For a comprehensive example of how this can be done, you can explore the [DNS contract deployment scenario test generator](https://github.com/klever-io/klever-go/tree/develop/kvm/cmd/testgen/dns).

If you're interested in this approach, further details and examples can be explored in the provided links.
